# racket-pgm

Work in Progress.  This is not a license.

An ad-hoc, informally specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of python's libpgm.

The author felt that it would be instructive (to him) to implement representation, inference and learning for a pgm, and that it would be fun to do so in typed racket.

graph-lib.rkt is shamelessly copied from https://github.com/stchang/graph, but the author only implemented [less than] half of Stephen Chang's good work.  This was done only so that one could specify graphs of specific types, say, (Graph RandomVariable).  The author thought it was pretty.
